    <h2>Data Types</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Undefined</strong> are data types that hasn't been assigned a value yet.
        It can be a variable that no value has been assigned to it.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Null</strong> is nothing, it means you declare a variable with the value of null.</p>
    <p><strong>Boolean</strong> is true or false.</p>
    <p><strong>Number</strong> is a number.</p>
    <p><strong>String</strong> is text.</p>
    <p><strong>Symbol</strong>...</p>
    <p><strong>Object</strong>...</p>
    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p><strong>Variables</strong> are containers for store and manipulate data.</p>
    <p>They can be created with <strong>var</strong>, <strong>let</strong> or <strong>const</strong>.</p>
    <script>
        var myName = 'Ryan';
        let lastName = 'Silva';
        console.log(myName);
        console.log(lastName);
        let completeName = myName + ' ' + lastName;
        console.log(completeName);
    </script>
    <script>
        const pi = 3.14;
        let raio = 10;
        let area, area2;
        area = pi * raio * raio;
        area2 = pi * (raio + 5) * (raio + 5);
        console.log(area);
        console.log(area2);
    </script>
    <p>The diference between var and let is that a var is going to be able to be used throughout your whole program and let is going to be limited to the scope of where you declared it. const is a variable should/it can never change</p>
